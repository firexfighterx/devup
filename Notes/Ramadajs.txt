immutability is key (don’t lick my candy bar)
small functions that are defined once and used everywhere
functions piped together take in functions as parameters to define how rambda uses it.
Rebel allows you to test out rambda things on their site.
path => looks for a specific value on an object safely otherwise undefined, pathOr same thing but allows for a default value.
defaultTo => provides a default value for a value;
allPass => functions defined with propsEq to make sure a property equals a value. if all are passing function returns true, otherwise false
anyPass => equal to or statement like allPass
tap => “tap” into the array of a pipe statement and see what values are before it gets passed along (console.log as an example)
curry => updates a piece of an object and returns a new one
